//! Scalar mathematical operations.
//!
//! This module implements fundamental mathematical operations on scalar values,
//! including trigonometric functions, exponential/logarithmic functions, and
//! other elementary functions, all from first principles.

// Placeholder: Will be implemented in next steps
